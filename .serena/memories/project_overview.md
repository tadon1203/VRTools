# VRTools project overview
- Purpose: Windows C++17 shared library (DLL) that hooks VRChat/Unity (Il2Cpp) with DirectX11 to add in-game overlay, HUD, and feature modules (e.g., PlayerESP). Entry flows through `src/dllmain.cpp` and `src/Core/Core` to initialize logging, settings, hooks, and UI toggle (Insert key).
- Tech stack: CMake-based build; dependencies fetched via FetchContent (minhook v1.3.4, fmt 12.1.0, nlohmann_json v3.12.0, imgui v1.92.5 with Freetype VER-2-14-1); links against D3D11 and dbghelp. Uses ImGui DX11/Win32 backends.
- High-level structure: Core (bootstrap, logger, crash handler, settings); Hooking (GameHooks, WndProcHook, HookManager); Features (FeatureManager, categories, Visuals modules like PlayerESP and ESP utils); HUD (components/logs) and UI (ImGui menu with pages for features, HUD editor, settings, main menu); Rendering (Renderer setting up D3D11 + ImGui); Input (Cursor/Input managers, keybind registration); SDK shims for Unity/Il2Cpp/VRChat (Game, Il2Cpp, Unity); Utils (color, ImGui helpers, JSON converters, math, pattern scan, render utils).
- Entrypoints/runtime: DLL entry in `src/dllmain.cpp` sets up Core; hooks initialize DX11/Win32 and Unity/Il2Cpp bindings; menu toggled with Insert; notifications via HUD/UI managers.
- Build artifacts: shared library target `VRTools` built from all `src/*.cpp/hpp` plus imgui backend sources.
